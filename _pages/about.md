I’m a 4th-year Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto, majoring in Robotics with a minor in Machine Intelligence.

I invented [AutoSplat](https://autosplat.github.io/) during a 16-month research internship at [Huawei, Noah's Ark Lab](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/), creating digital twins of autonomous driving scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The framework outperformed state-of-the art methods such as [EmerNeRF](https://emernerf.github.io/) from [NVIDIA](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/), leading to a patent and first-author paper submitted to [ICRA 2025](https://2025.ieee-icra.org/).

Currently, I’m working on generalizable 3D vision for autonomous driving as part of my bachelor's thesis with Professor [Steven Waslander](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/steven-waslander) at the [Toronto Robotics and AI Lab (TRAIL)](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/).

At the same time, I’m researching the mechanistic interpretability of foundation models (e.g. DINOv2, LLaMA) with Professor [Vardan Papyan](https://sites.google.com/view/vardan-papyan/home) at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). 

I also serve as the [Technical Director of Perception](https://www.autodrive.utoronto.ca/our-team) at [aUToronto](https://www.autodrive.utoronto.ca/), UofT’s self-driving car team, where I lead teams in 2D Vision, 3D Object Detection, and Tracking. Our efforts have propelled the University of Toronto to multiple [1st-place](https://www.utoronto.ca/news/u-t-team-takes-top-spot-self-driving-car-challenge-6th-time-7-years#:~:text=Latest%20news-,U%20of%20T%20team%20takes%20top%20spot%20in%20self%2Ddriving,6th%20time%20in%207%20years&text=A%20team%20from%20the%20University,American%20self%2Ddriving%20car%20competition.) finishes in the SAE Autodrive Challenge against 9 universities.

### Research Interests
- Representation learning and interpretability of foundation models
- Self-supervised learning (SSL) and emergence of robust visual features
- Deep learning theory (neural collapse, phase transitions, information bottleneck)
- Generalizable understanding of the world (3D representation learning, vision for autonomous systems)
