description:
  Previous methods in scene reconstruction rely on NeRFs, which are computationally expensive to train and exhibit reduced visual quality during ego-vehicle lateral shifts. We propose AutoSplat, a framework for realistic reconstruction of autonomous driving scenes using Gaussian splatting. To fulfill this task, we introduce geometric constraints that improves view synthesis, particularly for lane changes scenarios. By leveraging 3D templates and estimating residual spherical harmonics, we model the visible and unseen sides of foreground objects and its dynamic appearance.
